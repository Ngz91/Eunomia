# Eunomia
Analyze your code locally using a LLM. No data shared and no internet connection required after downloading the necessary files.

# How to use

Eunomia uses Chroma to create a vector database with the files in the directory where is run and then uses langchain to feed the vector database to the LLM of your choice. As of now, only GPT4All models are supported since I have no access to ChatGPT, but you can change the code to use OpenAI models instead of GPT4All.
